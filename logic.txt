Memory Game

Game randomly selects 15 pokemon to use for the game cards
The game creates 2 cards for each pokemon selected
The cards are shuffled, then displayed to the page face down

A user clicks on a card, that card is flipped over to reveal the pokemon underneath
That card stays flipped over until the user clicks on a second card

Once 2 cards have been clicked, compare them to see if they are a match 
if they are a match, leave the cards displayed
    increment score
    check for game win condition - all the cards are flipped over 
if they are not the same, flip them back over to hidden
    increment Incorrect guesses
    check for game lost condition - incorrect guesses = a certain number (or use a timer?)

Create Pokemon JSON data that has { id (unique), pokedexNum(used to compare matches), isFlipped (boolean for game logic), img}

Create a script that imports the assets - 
Loop over and build the JSON objects
use FS to create file
